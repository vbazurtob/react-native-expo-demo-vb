This is demo project to showcase a mobile app built with **React Native** & **Expo**.

The app contains 2 tabs: **Cards** & **News**.

1. The **Cards** tab showcases scrolling through some digital identification 
cards (id badges). The purpose of the code in this tab is to showcase
the ability of creating scrollable custom layouts that can be
styled.


2. The **News** tab showcases fetching a remote datasource, parsing it
and presenting it inside the app using a custom component. In this 
example the data source used was the latest news of the day from 
the White House.
