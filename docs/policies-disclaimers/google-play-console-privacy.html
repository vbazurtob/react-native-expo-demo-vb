<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This application (react-native-expo-demo-vb

    or share any personal data from users.

<ul>
    <li>Displaying a static list of fictional ID badges</li>

<h2>4. App Functionality</h2>

<h3>Static ID Badge List</h3>

    The App displays a static list of randomly generated, fictional ID badges
    (name, last name, initials, and member ID).
    All displayed information is fictitious and not linked to real individuals.
</p>

<h3>Public News Feed</h3>
<p>
    The App retrieves and displays publicly available RSS news content from the
    official public news feed of The White House.
</p>
<p>
    The App does not modify the content and does not track user interaction
    with the news feed. No personal data is transmitted when retrieving
    publicly available RSS content.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    The App may retrieve publicly available RSS data from external sources.
    However:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No analytics services are used</li>
    <li>No advertising services are used</li>
    <li>No user data is shared with third parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
    Because the App does not collect or store personal data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No personal information is stored on any server</li>
    <li>No user database exists</li>
    <li>No data retention applies</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
    The App does not collect personal information from anyone,
    including children under 13 years of age.
</p>

</ul>
